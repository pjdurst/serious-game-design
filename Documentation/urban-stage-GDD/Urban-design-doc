Potential Stages:
  Beach Side Boardwalk:
      A beach with a bustling business center. Filled with lots of local businesses and both vehicle and foot traffic. Extremely popular with both tourists and locals, the beach is almost always bustling with activity.
  Just a Beach:
      A private or public beach. There’s none to very little actual business on the beach, maybe a small italian ice stand but that’s about it. However, there’s a lot of foot traffic from many people coming to relax.
  Harbor and Port (+ Dock ig):
      A place for large ships to rest and reload. Very few civilians are around, instead the place is filled with sailors and other workers. They are constantly loading and unloading goods, preparing for ships to enter and leave.
  Untamed Wilderness:
      Very little to no human interaction. It’s a place nearly untouched by civilization. Plants and animals thrive on the beach. Can have humans move in over the course of the game, seeing how beachside development impacts the surrounding ecosystem.
